# It Is Now

Web page that acts as a descriptive clock for people that need a little
help keeping track of time.  Includes descriptions of time in other time-zones.
Can list repeating events (by day of week only) and dated events.

Fork and customize to make one that suits your situation.

Attempts to calculate hemisphere to describe season, but that only works for
locations that observe daylight saving time.  You an set it explicitly if needed.
